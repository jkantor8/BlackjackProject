# Blackjack Project

# Description

	This is a basic Blackjack program that allows a single player to play against a dealer. The game is able to create a deck, shuffle the cards, then deal two cards to each player, with only one of the dealer card's showing. The player can hit H or S to hit or stay as long as they have not exceeded 21. Once they have stayed or busted, the dealer's other card is shown and cards are added to their hand until they bust or are at 17 or greater.

# Technologies Used

	Java

# Lessons Learned

	In this project, I learned about using object-oriented programming concepts to implement a simple version of the game of Blackjack. I also gained experience in implementing basic decision making in a program using if-else statements and other types of loops. Further, I utilized ArrayLists to effectively manage and manipulate multiple objects of the same class, which helped me understand the power and versatility of this data structure. Overall, this project reinforced my understanding of these programming concepts and allowed me to apply them in a practical and entertaining way.
